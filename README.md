# NewroSim

NewroSim is a tool for simulating DNN in pseudo-CBA neuromorphic hardware. It was inspired by [MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0) but has totally different structure and was made from scratch by Mingi Kim(Undergraduate Student, Major in Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University). Default parameters of hardware physical properties are originated from [MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0).

## Install and Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cyansky99/NewroSim.git

$ unzip data.zip
$ make
$ ./main
```
